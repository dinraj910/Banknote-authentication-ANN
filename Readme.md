## 🧠 Model Architecture

The deep learning model employs:
- **Input Layer**: 4 features (variance, skewness, curtosis, entropy)
- **Hidden Layers**: Dense layers with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: Single neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification
- **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with binary cross-entropy loss
- **Regularization**: Dropout layers to prevent overfitting

## 📊 Model Performance & Comparison

### Deep Learning Results (ANN)
- **Accuracy**: 99.0%+ (Achieved through neural network optimization)
- **Precision**: 99% for both genuine and counterfeit detection
- **Recall**: 99% balanced across all classes
- **F1-Score**: 99% weighted average
- **AUC**: >0.99 (Excellent discrimination capability)

### 🔬 Comparative Analysis: ANN vs Traditional ML

We conducted a comprehensive comparison between our **Deep Learning approach** and **Traditional Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression) to validate our model choice:

| Metric | Neural Network | Logistic Regression | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | 99.0% | 97.82% | **+1.18%** |
| **Training Time** | ~30 seconds | <1 second | Trade-off |
| **Model Complexity** | 200+ parameters | 5 parameters | Higher capacity |
| **Interpretability** | Low (Black box) | High (Clear coefficients) | Domain dependent |

### 🎯 Why Neural Network Outperforms

1. **Non-linear Pattern Recognition**: Captures complex feature interactions that linear models miss
2. **Feature Learning**: Automatically discovers optimal feature combinations
3. **Robustness**: Better generalization on unseen banknote patterns
4. **Scalability**: Can easily accommodate additional features or complexity

### 🏆 Business Impact of Accuracy Improvement

- **1.18% accuracy boost** = ~130 fewer misclassifications per 10,000 transactions
- **Reduced False Positives**: Less customer inconvenience and operational friction
- **Enhanced Fraud Detection**: Better identification of sophisticated counterfeits
